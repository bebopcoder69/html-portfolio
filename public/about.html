<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m a tech enthusiast transitioning into software and web development, leveraging a strong foundation in sales, 
  client relationships, and project implementation. My journey in tech began in 2020, working for companies like WP Engine, 
  SUSE, Luxury Presence, and Nurp, where I honed my ability to understand customer needs, deliver solutions, and collaborate
   with cross-functional teams. Now, I’m focused on building the technical skills required for full-stack development, with
   a long-term goal of diving into the exciting world of AI and machine learning.</p>

<p>With hands-on experience in CRM tools like HubSpot, Salesforce, and project management systems such as Asana, Zendesk, and
   Jira, I bring a unique perspective to development. I aim to craft user-friendly applications that bridge the gap 
   between functionality and client needs. While I’m still early in my coding journey, I’m driven by curiosity and a 
   commitment to learning through real-world projects. My approach combines theoretical study with hands-on practice, and 
   I enjoy collaborating with others to create meaningful solutions.</p>

<p>I’m currently working on building a portfolio of projects that showcase my skills in full-stack development and 
  demonstrate my ability to deliver tangible results. As I grow my expertise, I’m excited to connect with mentors and 
  professionals in the tech community to share knowledge and discover opportunities. My ultimate goal is to land an 
  entry-level role by the end of 2025 while creating impactful projects along the way that reflect my passion for technology and 
  problem-solving.</p>
